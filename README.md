MAJOR WIP!
Consider this a pre-alpha. I wrote this while drinking havily so it ***works***... but it also needs ***major*** refactoring and, like, basic documentation. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Notes:

**conversations.json** is a log of all messages sent to openAI. Currently you must initiate a conversation manually and add it to conversations.json file to start the chain. I'll fix this in the next commit.

**memories.json** stores values that you would like to perssist upon server reboot. I'm not sure if my code is total shit or this is by design, but when you disconnect and reconnect from the chatGPT api it won't let you use a previous parentMessageId or conversationId. As such, server reboots or script restarts cause the Ai to forget context. Values stored in memories.json will be passed to ChatGPT on bootstrap. You can use **/store** from discord to add to this file. There's no remove function yet so be careful what you store ;)
